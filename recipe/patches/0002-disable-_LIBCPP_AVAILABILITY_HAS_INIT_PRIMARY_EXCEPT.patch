Subject: [PATCH 2/4] disable _LIBCPP_AVAILABILITY_HAS_INIT_PRIMARY_EXCEPTION
 unconditionally

The required symbols (`___cxa_init_primary_exception` etc.) are in libcxxabi,
which we intentionally don't ship ourselves.

Therefore, we must disable this feature unconditionally, at least until our
macOS baseline is >=15.0, as we rely on the libcxxabi shipped by the system.
