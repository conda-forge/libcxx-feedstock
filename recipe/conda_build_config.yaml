  # w.r.t. to the ABI of the system libcxx, this would need to be 12.0 on macos
  # but as we only publish one build to main, maintain global lower bounds

# hardening modes can be useful to detect misuse or undefined behaviour, especially
# as all modes maintain the same ABI; while the fast mode has essentially no runtime
# impact, it uses a default assertion handler that just crashes (see #162) and is
# therefore not a good choice for production builds. We provide fully hardened
# "debug" builds in a separate channel, which can be used for testing, but must be
# avoided in production (which we enforce with a run-export). For more details see
# https://libcxx.llvm.org/Hardening.html

# in some scenarios, libraries will load a cached _system_ libc++, and if we have an
# ABI-mismatch with that system lib, segfaults ensue (see libcxx-testing-feedstock);
# because the ABI changed with macOS 12, we build a version each for before & after
