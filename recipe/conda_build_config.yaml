# w.r.t. to the ABI of the system libcxx, c_stdlib_version would need to be 12.0
# on macos, but as we only publish one build to main, maintain global lower bounds

# in some scenarios, libraries will load a cached _system_ libc++, and if we have an
# ABI-mismatch with that system lib, segfaults ensue (see libcxx-testing-feedstock);
# because the ABI changed with macOS 12, we build a version each for before & after
